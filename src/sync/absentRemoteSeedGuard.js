/**
 * The file tier's seed guard: an absent remote file is not a licence to write.
 *
 * ── The hazard ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `@glance-apps/sync`'s file engine runs download → merge → upload, and takes a
 * provider `download()` that resolved falsy as "there is no remote file yet, so
 * seed it from local state":
 *
 *     const downloaded = await provider.download(cfg);
 *     if (!downloaded) {
 *       // Empty remote — seed it with local state.
 *       if (!(await upload({ skipLockCheck: true }))) uploadFailed = true;
 *       return false;
 *     }
 *
 * For every WebDAV provider (nextcloud, koofr, webdav) falsy means exactly one
 * thing — HTTP 404 (`providers.js`: `if (res.status === 404) return null`). That
 * write is unconditional in both senses that matter: `skipLockCheck` also drops
 * the If-Match validator, so the server has no way to refuse it, and nothing was
 * merged because nothing was read. So a 404 on a device that has synced before —
 * an outbound proxy answering for a host it cannot reach, a path that resolved
 * differently this time, a captive portal — replaces the remote snapshot with
 * this device's whole local copy, and the remote's newer rows are gone with
 * nothing on either side left to notice.
 *
 * dayGLANCE's existing upload validator does not cover this: it refuses an EMPTY
 * payload over a populated local store (adapter.js, the stale-state race). The
 * payload here is an older *complete* snapshot, which is exactly what passes it.
 *
 * ── The rule, and why it is the snapshot tier's ────────────────────────────
 * iCloud and Direct Access already had to answer this question and settled it
 * (utils/icloudSeedGuard.js): absence is TIMED, not trusted. The decision itself
 * is shared from the package as `evaluateMissingSnapshot` / `MISSING_GRACE_MS`,
 * and this module applies it to the file tier rather than growing a second rule
 * that could drift from the first.
 *
 * The trade is bounded in both directions, which is the whole point: a 404 that
 * clears inside the grace window never writes, and a file that is genuinely gone
 * — the user deleted it, the server was rebuilt, the path moved for good — still
 * re-seeds once the window expires, with no user action and no way to get stuck.
 * A device that has never synced seeds immediately: nothing can have been
 * evicted on a first run, and refusing forever would strand it.
 *
 * ── Where the evidence comes from ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The engine hands the upload validator an envelope and nothing else, so the
 * read outcome cannot be inferred there. The seam that can see it is the
 * providers map the engine itself reads (`providers[cfg.provider]`), so the
 * guard observes reads by wrapping each provider's `download`.
